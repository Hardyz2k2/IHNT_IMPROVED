- ‚ùå No target persistence
- ‚ùå Manual window switching for controls

### Current YOLO Version Advantages:
- ‚úÖ 30+ FPS real-time processing (10x faster)
- ‚úÖ Visual recognition catches moving mobs reliably
- ‚úÖ AI-powered detection independent of text
- ‚úÖ Multi-mob detection in crowded scenes
- ‚úÖ Intelligent target persistence until mob dies
- ‚úÖ Global hotkeys (no window switching needed)
- ‚úÖ Active hunting mode finds mobs automatically
- ‚úÖ Health bar monitoring for smart target switching

## Technical Architecture

### YOLO Workflow ‚úÖ
1. **Ultra-Fast Capture**: 30+ FPS screen capture of optimized game area
2. **AI Processing**: YOLO neural network processes entire frame instantly
3. **Smart Filtering**: Real-time exclusion of protected character areas
4. **Visual Recognition**: Direct mob detection without text dependencies
5. **Target Persistence**: Intelligent tracking until health bar disappears
6. **Active Hunting**: Automatic exploration when no mobs visible
7. **Real-Time Loop**: Continuous processing for moving target detection

### Protection System ‚úÖ
- **Position-Based**: 150-pixel safety radius around screen center
- **Real-Time Filtering**: Automatic exclusion during detection
- **Interactive Setup**: Character/pet name entry for reference
- **Configurable**: Adjustable protection radius in code

### Performance Features ‚úÖ
- **GPU Acceleration**: CUDA support for maximum speed
- **FPS Control**: Target 30+ FPS with automatic throttling
- **Memory Optimization**: Efficient processing pipeline
- **Multi-Threading**: Separate keyboard automation thread

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Start
1. **Install**: Double-click `INSTALL.bat` (first time only)
2. **Run**: Double-click `I-HNT.bat` or run `python i_hnt.py`
3. **Control**: Press CapsLock in game window to start/pause
4. **Stop**: Ctrl+C in terminal or hotkey controls

### Global Hotkey Controls
- **CapsLock**: Start/Pause/Resume Toggle (works from game window)
- **No Window Switching**: Stay focused on game
- **Emergency Stop**: Ctrl+C in terminal

### Training Custom Model (Recommended)
- See `README_YOLO.md` for detailed training instructions
- Collect 100-500 game screenshots
- Annotate with bounding boxes around mobs
- Train custom YOLO model for game-specific accuracy

## System Requirements
- **OS**: Windows 10/11 (primary), Linux/macOS (compatible)
- **Python**: 3.8+ recommended
- **RAM**: 8GB+ recommended for YOLO processing
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA recommended for 30+ FPS
- **Display**: 1920√ó1080 resolution (adjustable in code)
